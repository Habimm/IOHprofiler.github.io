IOHexperimenter
============================================

**IOHexperimenter** is a platform for testing iterative heuristic algorithms. It supplies a set of benchmark problems, allows users to test algorithms with well-desinged and customized output data format, and supports defining new test problems. Working with [IOHanalyzer](http://iohprofiler.liacs.nl/), users can easily generate output of algorithms with **IOHexperimenter** and analyze with **IOHanalyzer**

[The source code](https://github.com/IOHprofiler/IOHexperimenter/tree/NewStructure/src) of **IOHexperimenter** is programmed by C++, and interface for Python, Java, R will be release soon.
