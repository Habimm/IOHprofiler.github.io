Preparation
============================================

* [Benchmarking using C++](/IOHexperimenter/Cpp/)
* [Benchmarking using R](/IOHexperimenter/R/)
* [Adding new Functions / Suites](/IOHexperimenter/Adding-Functions/)

<b>IOHexperimenter</b> is <i>built on</i>:

* `C++` (tested on `gcc 5.4.0`)
* `boost.filesystem` library for logging files.

Because of this, the boost library needs to be installed to be able to use the __IOHexperimenter__. To install boost, please visit [https://www.boost.org](https://www.boost.org). Once boost is installed, you are now able to use the IOHexperimenter in the programming language of your choise.
