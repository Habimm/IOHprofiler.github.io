# Profiling Iterative Optimization Heuristics

**IOHprofiler** is a tool for benchmarking and analyzing and _iterative optimization heuristics_ (IOHs), e.g., Evolutionary Algorithms and Swarm-based Algorithms. It consists of two parts:

* __IOHexperimenter__ for generating benchmarking suites, which produce experiment data, and
* __IOHanalyzer__ for the statistical analysis and visualization of the experiment data.

The common workflow of benchmaking and empirical analysis is shown as follows:

[__IOHexperimenter__](IOHexperimenter/) provides,

* a generic framework to generate benchmarking suite for the optimization task you're insterested in,
* a _Pseudo-Boolean Optimization_ ([PBO](/Suites/PBO/)) benchmark suite, containing 23 test problems of the kind $f\colon \\{0,1\\}^d \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$, and
* the integration of 24 _Black-Box Optimization Benchmarking_ ([BBOB](https://coco.gforge.inria.fr/downloads/download16.00/bbobdocfunctions.pdf)) functions on the continuous domain, namely $f\colon \mathbb{R}^d \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$.

[__IOHanalyzer__](IOHanalyzer/) provides:

* a web-based interface to analyze and visualize the empirical performance of IOHs,
* interactive plot,
* statistical evaluation,
* report generation, and
* `R` programming interfaces in the backend.
