IOHprofiler: A Benchmarking and Profiling Tool for Iterative Optimization Heuristics
============================================

**IOHprofiler** is a new tool for analyzing and comparing iterative optimization heuristics.
Given as input algorithms and problems written in C, C++, or Python*, it provides as output an in-depth statistical evaluation of the algorithmsâ€™ fixed-target and fixed-budget running time distributions. In addition to these performance evaluations, IOHprofiler also allows to track the evolution of algorithm parameters, making our tool particularly useful for the analysis, comparison, and design of (self-)adaptive algorithms.

IOHprofiler is a ready-to-use software. It consists of two parts: **IOHexperimenter**, which generates the running time data; and **IOHanalyzer**, which produces the summarizing comparisons and statistical evaluations.

## Source
Both source code of **IOHexperimenter** and **IOHanalyzer** are available in [github](https://github.com/IOHprofiler), **IOHanalyze** is also host [online](http://iohprofiler.liacs.nl/).
